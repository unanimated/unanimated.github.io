Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:01.00,Default,INSTRUCTIONS,0000,0000,0000,,{\an8\fs26\b0\shad0\bord5\blur1.5\c&H000000&\3c&HFFFFFF&}This is a test in fine timing, shifting, timing signs... and other stuff.\N\N{\fs24}As you may know, Commie does little translating and {\s1}steals scripts wherever possible{\s0} uses scripts from simulcasts.\N\NSome of them have to be typed (that's why we have Jukey), while others, \Nlike from Crunchy(T)roll, are ripped including timing & everything.\N\NThe timer's task then is to shift the script to our raw and fine time it.\N\N"Cool, that sounds easy!" you may think but fuck! it's not!\N\N{\fs24}Firstly, just shifting won't do. You're timing in milliseconds, not frames, so even if after shifting the script seems generally fine, plenty of start/end times may actually be half a frame off, which in some cases will happen to be ok while in other cases will cause a 1-frame bleed.\NWe're not ok here with 1-frame bleeds because we're not crunchy trolls.\NThere may also be additional shifting after OP/eyecatch/ED.\N\NSo you have to figure out how to not have any bleeds or I'll kill you. {\fs10}No, srsly...
Dialogue: 0,0:00:01.00,0:00:02.00,Default,INSTRUCTIONS,0000,0000,0000,,{\an8\fs24\b0\shad0\bord5\blur1.5\c&H000000&\3c&HFFFFFF&}As you may also know, Crunchy(T)roll employs a bunch of incompetent niggers, so along with imprecission of shifting you will encounter shitloads of timing derps, bleeds, mistimed lines, more bleeds, things that don't make sense and other weird crap.\N\NIn other words the shifted script is not nearly as good as your rough timed would be. \NSo you have 2 choices. Either you can try to work with this, or you can just erase the times and start from scratch. Option 2 is obviously the same as regular timing then.\N\NI use option 1 but still do 2 passes. In the first one [after it's shifted in the right place] I go through the lines quickly pressing G and looking at audio, fixing obvious bleeds and whatever seems odd - bad lead in/outs, bad linking etc. \N\NShifting alone is unreliable and your fine timing will take longer, fixing all the derps. This is at least a bit faster than starting from scratch.\N2nd pass is regular fine timing.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:02.00,0:00:03.00,Default,INSTRUCTIONS,0000,0000,0000,,{\an8\fs25\b0\shad0\bord5\blur1.5\c&H000000&\3c&HFFFFFF&}There are a few more things that you need to pay attention to.\N\N{\fs22}The editor will edit the translation but otherwise the script is handed to you as HS released it. That means it has {\b1}their{\b0} styles and possibly, like here, {\b1}their{\b0} songs.\NSo unless you're as useless as MisterX, you're gonna nuke the HS styles, import our styles from previous episode, nuke the songs, and import and shift {\b1}our{\b0} OP/ED.\NShould you happen to be as useless as MisterX then please GTFO.\N\N\N\N\N\N\N\N\N\N\N\N\NStyles can be nuked/imported either in the Styles Manager, or in notepad. Same with the songs.\NUse whichever method you want but I recommend to at least check what .ass files look like in notepad to be familiar with the headers and everything in the raw form.\N\NAfter importing our styles, make sure to also adjust the script resolution [in Properties]. Normaly we use 1280x720 for everything, Un-Go just happens to be 1024x576. {\fs10}Dunno, ask RHE.\N{\fs22}Along with making chapters, importing styles and changing the resolution should be a part of your routine for all shows, not just CR rips.

You can just use the imported styles, but do at least the positioning, fading, and make sure the colors, borders etc match.
