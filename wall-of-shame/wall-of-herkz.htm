No comma. If it's "so such-and-such <i>that</i> something", then there's no comma.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari01.jpg"><br><br>
Inconsistency. Comma after one "here," but not after the other.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari03.jpg"><br><br>
While this is not completely incorrect, if you want to call yourself an editor, "They wear the weirdest outfits on THEIR days off" would be a lot better.<br>
It's not <i>completely</i> clear whether "our" means the boys or includes the girls, or whether they have the same days off, so it would be a good edit for clarity.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari04.jpg"><br><br>
No comma.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari05.jpg"><br><br>
"last-minute" is an adjective. Try "at the last minute".
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari06.jpg">
<img src="TariTari07.jpg"><br><br>
Restrictive clause = no comma.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari08.jpg"><br><br>
No comma. (Crappy line breaking, too.)
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari09.jpg"><br><br>
No comma before "yourself".
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari10.jpg">
<img src="TariTari11.jpg"><br><br>
No comma before "and".
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari12.jpg">
<img src="TariTari13.jpg"><br><br>
No comma.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari14.jpg"><br><br>
This is not really a question. (Actually, it's not even a sentence.)
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari15.jpg"><br><br>
Comma splice.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari16.jpg"><br><br>
No comma.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari19.jpg">
<img src="TariTari20.jpg"><br><br>
You guessed it... no comma.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari21.jpg">
<img src="TariTari22.jpg"><br><br>
No comma here either.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari23.jpg"><br><br>
This makes no sense.<br>
Your line is saying: "Because I have to do some shopping, I can get home before the rain starts."<br>
Surely she could avoid the rain more easily if she didn't have to do any shopping.<br>
<br>
To give some context:<br>
<br>
Wien: Want to head to club practice together later?<br>
Wien: We're celebrating Taichi placing in the top eight.<br>
Wakana: Sorry, I have to do some shopping, so I can get home before the rain starts.<br>
<br>
At the very least, you have to drop the comma. The line is still somewhat unclear though, since it's not the shopping that will alow her to get home before the rain starts; it's skipping the club practice. This is implied by context, but not by grammar.<br>
It could use some rewording, like:<br>
"Sorry, I have shopping to do, and I'd like to get home before the rain starts."
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari24.jpg"><br><br>
No comma, please. He can't be useful just by wanting to get better. He needs to actually get better to be useful.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari26.jpg">
<img src="TariTari27.jpg"><br><br>
This is either a comma splice or a missing conjunction.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari28.jpg"><br><br>
Same here. "Then" is an adverb, not a conjunction.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari25.jpg">
<img src="TariTari29.jpg"><br><br>
This may or may not have a comma (if the clauses are short), but at least make it consistent.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari30.jpg"><br><br>
No comma.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari31.jpg"><br><br>
Comma splice.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari32.jpg"><br><br>
No comma. (This was a response to "How are you feeling?")
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari33.jpg"><br><br>
There should be a comma before "because" to prevent misreading.<br>
This would imply something like "They asked that you not participate because they can't be responsible for a minor getting hurt but because it you'd lose anyway."<br>
In other words, there's a difference between these two:<br>
"I don't want you to do it because you want to." (I want you to do it for another reason.)<br>
"I don't want you to do it, because you want to." (You want to, and I hate you, so I don't want you to do it. Just to spite you.)
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari34.jpg"><br><br>
Typical commie habit of putting profanity in the mouth of somebody who speaks properly and wouldn't use it.<br>
This is even more sad because there was hardly any effort to edit at all in this show. If you're too lazy to edit more than 10 lines per episode, at least don't make the 10 worse.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari35.jpg"><br><br>
No comma. The second clause is necessary for the point she's making here.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari36.jpg"><br><br>
Please. It's like somebody took a bag of commas and dumped it on these scripts.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari37.jpg"><br><br>
Nope. Try one of these instead:<br><br>
Hopes and dreams are the power that moves humanity and keeps the Earth turning!<br>
Hopes and dreams are the power that moves humanity, and they keep the Earth turning!<br>
Hopes and dreams move humanity and keep the Earth turning!
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari40.jpg"><br><br>
Getting it wrong two different ways is rather impressive.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari38.jpg"><br><br>
Comma splice, though not a big deal. It's a semicolon-type sentence, so it may fall in the realm of the acceptable.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari39.jpg"><br><br>
No comma.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari41.jpg"><br><br>
I think you mean <b>an</b> "h".
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari42.jpg"><br><br>
Some of these lines don't sound like schoolgirls talking. They sound more like herkz talking.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari43.jpg"><br><br>
While before school, they are allowed. This should be "after-school".
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari45.jpg">
<img src="TariTari46.jpg"><br><br>
And we're back to scattering random commas left and right. Or are you saying the middle part can be omitted?<br>
"That song were both essentially your creations." I don't think so.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari47.jpg"><br><br>
Here, on the other hand, you'd have been correct in placing a comma...
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari48.jpg">
<img src="TariTari49.jpg"><br><br>
...as would have been the case here.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari50.jpg"><br><br>
Unless "lately protecting" is a thing, there should be a comma after "lately".
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari51.jpg"><br><br>
Aside from a minor comma splice, what's with the typesetting?<br>
Why is "ies" blue and "the Frogs" black? Clearly the light is falling on "the Frogs," not on "ies".
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari52.jpg"><br><br>
I guess everything changed to no commas this episode.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari53.jpg"><br><br>
Why is there a comma before "alone"? The "alone" part is pretty essential.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari54.jpg"><br><br>
Couldn't.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari55.jpg"><br><br>
Nope. No comma. Keep trying. (Also, crappy line breaking.)
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari56.jpg"><br><br>
No. The penalizing is still part of the "If".
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari57.jpg"><br><br>
Comma splice.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari58.jpg"><br><br>
Comma after "competition". This could be misread as "the competition we signed" etc.
<br><br><br>
<img src="TariTari59.jpg"><br><br>
Oh, no, not, you, too! OK, this may not be incorrect, but it's pretty terrible.
<br><br><br><br><br>
Moving on to the next show... (yes, that was all one show)
<br><br>

<img src="lab01.jpg"><br><br>
"there is that kind" or "there are those kinds"
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab02.jpg"><br><br>
Comma please. It's not "the ball I kick at them and get to know them that way".<br>
It's "Save them from the ball, and get to know them that way".
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab03.jpg"><br><br>
Pretty sure this is serif.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab04.jpg"><br><br>
Pretty sure this is rounded. Also handwritten. Btw, this is the stuff you laugh at when other groups do it. Just sayin'...
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab05.jpg"><br><br>
I'm trying to come up with some obscure reason why somebody would put a comma here, but I can't.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab06.jpg"><br><br>
They're clearly inside, so try "outside of here".
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab07.jpg"><br><br>
"bottom-right" would be hyphenated if it was used as an adjective. It is, however, being used as a noun, so no.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab08.jpg"><br><br>
More top-quality typesetting, this time with slightly wrong \frz.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab09.jpg"><br><br>
Comma.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab10.jpg"><br><br>
Poor phrasing. They were doing something I wasn't supposed to? At least make it "something I wasn't supposed to see".<br>
Alternatively, it can be rephrased to something like "I happened to see the president and Kurahashi doing something secret" or "I saw something the president and Kurahashi didn't want me to".
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab11.jpg"><br><br>
The right way of the screw up is... up. The wrong way of the screw up is in any other direction than up.<br>
That is not what we're talking about here, though.<br>
It makes slightly more sense when changed to "screw-up", but "the way of the screw-up" implies something akin to "the way of the samurai". What you're looking for is "the right way of screwing up".
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab12.jpg"><br><br>
This is happening so often, I'm gonna call it SHS - Standard Herkz Sentence. (Pun intended.)
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab13.jpg"><br><br>
Nice font.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab15.jpg"><br><br>
Adverbs that modify the whole line should be separated by a comma. It's more obvious when it's not a question.<br>
Then we could each come up... (at that time)<br>
Then, we could each come up... (in that case)
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab16.jpg"><br><br>
SHS. Either period or no comma, depending on meaning.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab17.jpg"><br><br>
Just be the president then, and I'll be the president now. (Comma would be good.)
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab18.jpg"><br><br>
Herkz is the #2 guy to go to when you need weird/pointless contractions. He uses geysers too, like brainchild.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab19.jpg"><br><br>
This's pronounced "thissszzz". If I were herkz, I could even have written, "This's's pronounced "thissszzz"."
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab20.jpg"><br><br>
Thank god her name wasn't Jill, because people who write "this's" are clearly dumb enough to write "Jill'll".
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab21.jpg"><br><br>
Strangely, this kind of shit always ends up being said by those who speak most properly, like class reps, club presidents, etc.<br>
Also strangely, he uses commas before "though" which can only mean one thing and thus the line can't be misread, but not before "then".
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab22.jpg"><br><br>
This is pronounced "theezzzvvv". It's a bit more difficult to pronounce than "these have," but by all means, go for it.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab23.jpg"><br><br>
Japanese is brown, English is black (eyedropper tells me it's actually in the blue range).
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab24.jpg"><br><br>
Another SHS.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab26.jpg"><br><br>
Nice mask, but wrong colour. Also, really poor and unclear phrasing.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab25.jpg"><br><br>
Nice typesetting, but where is it?
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab27.jpg"><br><br>
Wait. Is this commie or horriblesubs?
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab31.jpg"><br><br>
"put your mind to it" You're putting your mind to doing the things, not to the things.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab28.jpg"><br><br>
This one can't even get the tenses right. Can if she puts. Could if she put.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab29.jpg"><br><br>
Yet another SHS.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab32.jpg"><br><br>
This should be "either".
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab33.jpg"><br><br>
How many times have I seen herkz laugh at CR with "tenses are hard"...
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab34.jpg"><br><br>
It's kind of bad to use the general "you" when she's actually talking about both of them. "talk to us" would be a lot better.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab35.jpg"><br><br>
Sounds like: herkz, maybe.<br>
Definitely does not sound like: Maki.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab36.jpg"><br><br>
Past perfect for something that happened after something you described with past simple = brilliant.<br>
Also, you're missing a comma.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab37.jpg"><br><br>
If I ever go to amerika, I will ask random schoolgirls this question to find out how many of them will have any clue what the fuck I'm talking about. I'm betting on zero.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab38.jpg"><br><br>
I will also try to find out how many people actually talk like this. I'm betting on zero.<br>
This might be one of the weirdest lines I've ever seen in subs, and I've seen at least two episodes by Hadena.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab39.jpg"><br><br>
"kinda" may work for Riko, but definitely not for Maki.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab40.jpg"><br><br>
Who was looking at Maki? The boys? Nope. The girl talking. Therefore, a comma after "boys" would be appreciated.<br>
Actually, make it "I-It's not like I got scared of boys or anything, looking at how Maki was acting earlier! Okay?" because the current phrasing is pretty clumsy.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab41.jpg"><br><br>
This might be a good time to say that if you want to (pretend to) be an editor, learning something about comma usage would be helpful.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab42.jpg">
<img src="lab43.jpg"><br><br>
This is a rather poor choice of words for both lines, especially since they're the first two lines in the episode.<br>
It's quite unclear what they're talking about.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab44.jpg"><br><br>
You Commie editors're awful.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab45.jpg"><br><br>
Sounds like somebody is looking up to brainchild and uses awkward lines that don't fit the character at all.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab46.jpg"><br><br>
Just to make a point: This one's OK. The words themselves are not the problem. The problem is that Riko (this girl) is about the only one of the whole gang that talks like this.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab48.jpg">
<img src="lab49.jpg"><br><br>
The two examples show the same type of sentence, but one uses a comma and the other one doesn't. How often do I see herkz laugh at CR for being inconsistent? Quite often.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab50.jpg"><br><br>
That's not a real word, unless Urban Dictionary is your preferred dictionary. Mizushima doesn't strike me as a big fan of UD.<br>
But hey, at least you didn't fuck up anything el Wait. Six monthiversary? That's like "six anniversary". I guess you <i>could</i> learn something about using hyphens once you figure out the basics of using commas, but that sounds like too much effort. Maybe you should just stick to using words that exist, and keep things simple.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab51.jpg"><br><br>
Nope. That is not how these girls talk. At all.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab52.jpg"><br><br>
As I was just saying...
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab53.jpg"><br><br>
When you get to that whole "how do I into commas and hyphens" business, throw in something about apostrophes.<br>
Oh, just in case you misunderstood: The one you used is not wrong. The one you didn't use is.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab54.jpg"><br><br>
You have to forgive herkz. Removing honorifics and making contractions is the only kind of "editing" he knows how to do well, so he puts all his effort into it. You could even say too much effort in the case of words like "this's".
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab55.jpg"><br><br>
Well, it went so quickly that there isn't really much to say about it.<br>
herkz  too quick for commas.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab57.jpg"><br><br>
"1984 The Anime" puts a whole new spin on the Big Brother agenda... (I'm afraid nobody in Commie gets this =/)
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab58.jpg"><br><br>
Oh look, another SHS, aka some of the worst misuse of commas there is.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab59.jpg"><br><br>
Here, take this: \bord2
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab60.jpg"><br><br>
How does any of this TS match anything??<br>
Also, I think I was too quick to praise herk'z effort regarding contractions. I wonder why this one stayed as "This is".<br>
Maybe he was too busy matching the TS to the Japanese.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab61.jpg"><br><br>
You don't use a comma after "but". I mean, you clearly do, but you shouldn't.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab62.jpg"><br><br>
Grey and brown are different colours.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab63.jpg"><br><br>
This can be misread pretty easily, so you could do something like... edit it, maybe.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab64.jpg"><br><br>
That's nice and all, but it doesn't fit the character.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab65.jpg"><br><br>
Standard amerikan elementary school vocabulary, I suppose? I wonder where you went to school...
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab66.jpg"><br><br>
I guess this is not exactly wrong, but i still can't figure out why the "surely" is at the end and not the beginning.<br>
Maybe if it was Zetsuen's Samon-dono philosophising, but an angry schoolgirl... Seems awkward.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab67.jpg"><br><br>
I thought this didn't make much sense, so I showed it to a native speaker without context, and they got the meaning of the line completely wrong. Seems like another one of those darn lines that might require some editing. Scary.
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab68.jpg"><br><br>
Yeah, that would be a problem. I mean, it would be bad enough if those yatsus got picky OR choosy, let alone both!
<br><br><br>
<img src="lab69.jpg">
<img src="lab70.jpg"><br><br>
Random insertion of comma, hoping to get it right: fail.
<br><br><br>

<img src="lab30.jpg"><br><br>
It will be funny if people found out herkz couldn't into English grammar.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
...and that was show #2. Some ~70 screenshots + about 30 more on the main Wall of Shame.<br>
Pretty impressive for "i actually know how english works".<br>
Next is Silver Spoon, which is not too bad, since CR did a much better job there than on Tari Tari, so there are fewer mistakes for herkz to leave in.
<br><br><br>

<img src="silverspoon01.jpg"><br><br>
Let's start with this cool typeset. It's in most episodes, and it's randomply misaligned at times. I don't know why.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon02.jpg"><br><br>
How long till herkz learns that "then" is not a conjunction?
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon03.jpg"><br><br>
Obligatory geysers, and obligatory bad commas (the second one).
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon04.jpg"><br><br>
It's pretty clear from context that the intended meaning for the top line is the one with a comma after "them".<br>
Also, "since" would make it clearer than "when".
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon05.jpg"><br><br>
Seriously, this is bad. =/ How can somebody calling themselves an editor miss so many commas that should be there and put in so many commas that shouldn't? This is almost like random-comma generator.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon06.jpg">
<img src="silverspoon07.jpg"><br><br>
No comma after "dream". The second line is still a part of the "even if".
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon08.jpg"><br><br>
T_T pls halp
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon09.jpg"><br><br>
This should be "fewer". It should also be "There are".
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon10.jpg"><br><br>
I can't really claim this is a "mistake", but I can't for the love of god figure out why the "Hey" would be after the "It stopped" and not before it. It sounds kind of dumb when you say it out loud.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon11.jpg">
<img src="silverspoon12.jpg"><br><br>
Same shit, different episode...
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon13.jpg">
<img src="silverspoon14.jpg"><br><br>
I'm afraid you chose the wrong way to translate "yappari" because this doesn't make sense. Following "I knew you would" with "I thought you might" just doesn't work. Try something like "So you came to drop by, after all!"
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon15.jpg"><br><br>
No. No. No. The point is not that we say it even if their brains are rotten. The point is that they can live even if their brains are rotten. This is why commas exist, you know? To prevent misreading and clear up which of two possible meanings is the intended one.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon16.jpg">
<img src="silverspoon17.jpg"><br><br>
Please explain what "them" is referring to. Because if you're killing lives, you're doing it wrong.<br>
Also the comma is wrong, but that was to be expected, wasn't it. (<- Period because it's rhetorical. [Sorry for the highlight.])
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon18.jpg"><br><br>
This is the kind of line you look at and go "Whoa, what? What happened here?" Well, I'll tell you what didn't happen. This line didn't pass an editor's eyes. First of all, the tenses are clearly wrong. It shouldn't be that hard to get them right... although I admit it would require actually looking at the line.<br>
Secondly, the line reads pretty awkwardly and includes possible misreadings, like "we'll need to be instantly tens of millions in the hole".<br>
The point of editing is not to remove honorifics, add contractions, and translate tsundere to hot'n'cold. The point of editing is to make lines grammatically correct (unless the character talks like shit), make them clear in meaning (unless the character talks like shit), and make the dialogue flow well (unless the character talks like shit). herkz doesn't seem to be concerned with any of these things whatsoever at all. Yes, whatsoever at all. That bad. (Or maybe he just thinks every character talks like shit.)
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon19.jpg"><br><br>
I think you were looking for "at the top", but I'm glad you're on top of things.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon20.jpg">
<img src="silverspoon21.jpg"><br><br>
Considering that there wasn't even any pause between the two lines, I wonder what you're doing here.<br>
Personally, I would also suggest that starting with "Now that" and ending with "today" doesn't really flow well.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon22.jpg"><br><br>
Apparently, tenses are yet another thing herkz can't seem to get right.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon23.jpg"><br><br>
I don't know how you guys do things in amerika, but in the rest of the world, flour doesn't grow. Crops do.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon24.jpg"><br><br>
These Standard Herkz Sentences are starting to hurt my brain.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon25.jpg"><br><br>
When shown to a native speaker, they got a completely different meaning out of it. The word you're looking for here (or would be looking for if you actually bothered) is something like "reckless" or "careless".

It feels kind of bad to post the same mistakes over and over, but I'm hoping that sooner or later it will force someone to learn some English grammar.
<br><br><br>

While this may be acceptable, like "god save the queen", I'm pretty sure that that the intention was to say "Goddamn teachers!"

One out of these three commas is correct. Congratulations! It's much better than 100% fail!
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon32.jpg"><br><br>
"Then" is not a conjunction. Commie a shit. Dropped.<br>
Also, if you actually wanted to edit the line, I got this nice suggestion from somebody:<br>
"Take him out to the exercise pen around this time of day and then back to the stables around noon."
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon33.jpg"><br><br>
Sorry. Your random-comma generator hit the wrong line again.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon34.jpg"><br><br>
Sorry. Your random-comma generator missed the right line again.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon35.jpg"><br><br>
Oh, god...<br>
Second line: Why in the bloody hell would you put a comma after "members"? I don't even...<br>
Third: Why is there "I'd hoped"? That doesn't add up. "In these modern times, I had hoped"?<br>
Why is there an ellipsis instead of a comma? There isn't even a pause in the audio.<br>
All that's missing is "guys've".
<br><br><br>

Please google "not only but also", and learn how to properly form a sentence of this type.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon38.jpg"><br><br>
Not bad. You got two commas right. (Okay, Crunchyroll got them right.) One is still missing, though.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon39.jpg"><br><br>
Took me a while to figure out what "ag" means, and I wasn't the only one. Some searching showed that "ag" can mean about a hundred things. Maybe making the line clearer wouldn't be bad.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon40.jpg"><br><br>
The second part is quite essential for the meaning, which means it's restrictive, which means no comma.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon41.jpg"><br><br>
Some people say, "At least herkz adds typesetting to HS." But is this really any better than HS? The least you could do is not let it overlap with those lines.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon42.jpg"><br><br>
No. No comma. You're changing the meaning again.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon43.jpg"><br><br>
The first line is not a whole sentence. You can't start with "not only" and not finish with the "but also" part.<br>
"People with deep empathy are not only struck by wonder when flowers are in full bloom, but they also experience joy when flowers are about to bloom(,) and melancholy when flowers wilt and fade away."
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon44.jpg"><br><br>
There is no good reason why this should be "hadn't" instead of "haven't".
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon45.jpg"><br><br>
Halp! A meat hunt is targeting me!<br>
While personification of a meat hunt is pretty funny, I wouldn't go as far as calling it good editing.<br>
"I'll become a target of a meat hunt!" might sound less ridiculous.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon46.jpg"><br><br>
Those three guys are shouting this line in unison. You can get the feeling from the picture.<br>
I've been trying to imagine three guys shouting "Uh" in unison, but it's not working.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon47.jpg"><br><br>
Welp, that's the third time. I guess herkz really doesn't get it.<br>
If, by any chance, he'd like to argue that it's to prevent misreading, which would be bullshit because that would be the first time he ever cared about a misreading, it could be changed to "I'll ask him myself!"<br>
Besides, the line would cause just as much of a mishearing as it would cause a misreading, so a comma hardly helps anyway.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon48.jpg"><br><br>
I can see that you're slowly getting into the business of using hyphens, but i'm afraid you're doing it wrong.<br>
You want an adverb here, not an adjective  unless you normally say, "That house is distant," rather than "That house is far."
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon50.jpg"><br><br>
Aside from the awkward phrasing, you're missing a period.
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon36.jpg"><br><br>
It's "nerve-racking" or "nerve-wracking".
<br><br><br>
<img src="silverspoon51.jpg"><br><br>
The last part is restrictive, so no comma.<br>
Also, this line naturally breaks after "livestock", and you normally don't use linebreaks, so I don't get why you'd go out of your way to put a linebreak in a weird place when it was perfectly fine without it.
<br><br><br><img src="silverspoon49.jpg"><br><br>
'Sup, bro? How's it all been?<br>
I assure you the principal definitely doesn't talk like that. And I can almost hear you say, "Wasn't me. That was crunchyroll." If that's your excuse and you're going to continue to blame all your mistakes on translators (like you blamed all the missing words in Love Lab on Futsuu), please stop editing, because an "editor" who can't fix or even find mistakes is worthless.
